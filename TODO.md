# Cookiecutter template TODO

## Must do

- Check if ran with `cruft create` command
- Pre init: install `UV` for VENV
- Add VENV with `UV`
- Add info as to what to do after init and venv:
  - `uv add . -e --dev`
- Change: `run()` starts command that creates class and start instead of creating class
- Check if `pre-commit` hook is installed

## Nice-To-Have

- `pre-commit autoupdate` as post hook
- `cruft update` as make recipe
